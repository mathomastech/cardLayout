        <p class="cardContent"> The card design has 4 main parts. They are the <strong>card</strong> (basic, left, right, small, medium, large), the <strong>header</strong> (left, right, center), the <strong>content</strong> and the <strong>footer</strong> (left, right center). Each card should use only what it needs, and nothing extra.The next few cards will show you the difference between left and right, and the different sizes.
