        <h3 class="cardBasicHeaderMiddle">Card Anatomy</h3>
        <p class="cardContent"> The card design has 4 main parts. 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>card:</strong> basic, left, right, small, medium, large</li>
            <li><strong>header:</strong> left, right, center</li>
            <li><strong>content:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>footer:</strong> left, right, center</li> 
        </ul>        
        Each card should use only what it needs, and nothing extra. The following cards will show you the different options you can use to build your cards. Header and footer placements can be mixed and match. For instance, you can combine a left header and a right footer, or a middle header and a left footer. Use whatever combinations you feel are best for your content. Be away that using multiple headers or multiple footers on a single card does not work.
